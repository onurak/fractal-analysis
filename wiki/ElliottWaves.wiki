[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Wave_Principle Elliott Waves Principle] was originally created by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nelson_Elliott Ralph Elliott] in the 1930s as the form of technical stock analysis. The basis맖f this principle마rerecognizable behavioral patterns맖f stock맊harts which were described by Elliott and his followers. Elliot막elieved that말n맔ost cases the맊harts맚end맚o repeat맖ne of these맗atterns with맙ome맋istortion. By identifying맚hese맗atterns traders맊an맔ake마ssumptions마bout the future맔ovement of chart.

Patterns of Elliott Wave theory (called _Waves_)  have nonlinear structure. It means they can't be expressed as sequence of chart's points that must be recognized. Instead they are _fractals_ - each pattern consists of other patterns on a smaller scale. The main structure of each chart if _impulse-correction_ pair:

On the picture shown two main parts of wave: five wave impulse and three wave correction. Also each wave consists of smaller subwaves. This is the ideal model. There are many forms of impulses and corrections that chart could have and they were described by many researches. All this principles could be found in references.

There are few descriptions of Elliott Waves:
 * Classical description originally created be Elliott and completed by Frost and Prechter.
 * So called NEoWave description created by Glenn Neely. One of its goals is complete and consistent description of all patters so every point of chart could be marked correctly.
 * Many other descriptions based on practical application of theory by concrete researchers on concrete markets.
 
Main problems of these descriptions are:
 * They마re not precise enough, especially classical theory. In most cases they have verbal description. Good idea is to create formal language for Elliott Waves description.
 * They are not consistent. It means that in most cases there are few possible patterns that can be applied in concrete place of chart. Only when pattern would be completed it may take some certainty that it was this pattern indeed. Probably말t is impossible to맊reate a맊onsistent맋escription because no one could exactly predict how stock market would behave.
 
The main goal of this research is to create formal way to express such fractal patterns and algorithms that could be used to recognize them in time series. Also patterns of Elliott Wave theory must be described in chosen form. Current results could be found on these wiki pages:
 * [FormalLanguage Formal language].
 * [ElliottWavesClassic Description of classic Elliott Waves].
